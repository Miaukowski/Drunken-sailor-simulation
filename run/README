The program wants three arguments as command line inputs: 

	1. The number of simulations/iterations you'd like to do.
	2. Do you want to print trajectories (yes = 1, no = 0), so input either 0 or 1. 
	3. Do you want to do a SAW or NON-SAW (yes = 1, no = 0), so input either 0 or 1.


ALSO PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THE output.dat FILE! 
The program simply overwrites over the old data for every "run". 
(the current content on the output.dat file (as an example), comes from a run done with 100 iterations and SAW)


If you'd like to plot the trajectories (Only recommended for 5 or less iterations, it gets messy quickly) do either one of the following: 

Use the script i made:
	-run the program
	write the following into the command line:
	-gnuplot
	-load "print_trajectories.gp"
	
	
manually plot: 
	- run the program 
	write the following into the command line:
	- gnuplot
	- set key off (the legend has a tendency to overlap with the plotted trajectories, remove this statement if you still like to have the legend in the plot)
	- set xrange[:11] (the shore is at +x 10, so it's nice to see when they stop. 
	- set xlabel "x-coordinates"
	- set ylabel "y-coordinates"
	- plot for [i=0:*] 'output.dat' i i u 1:2 w l lc i t sprintf('This is iteration %d', i)
